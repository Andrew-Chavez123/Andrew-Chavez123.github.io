### CPSC 120

* [Lab 2](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-02-Andrew-Chavez123)

    Lab 2, part 1 was a favorite lab of mine. It wasn't hard but all my 
    life I want to learn how to code. Here I was able to write code for
    the first time that coverted fahrenheit to celsius using variables, 
    cout, and cin statements.

* [Lab 6](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-06-vanessa-iwaki-and-andrew-chavez)

    Lab 6, part 1 was a favorite lab of mine because on social media 
    I've always seen patterns like this. I was always curious about 
    how the patterns were made. In this lab, I was able to write loops
    and nested loops to make the pattern.

* [Lab 5](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-05-team-2)

    Lab 5, part 1 was a favorite because I learned a very useful tool in this 
    lab, reading command line arguments. It was hard but still very fun to code.
    In this lab, I was able to write a program that makes a sandwich using command 
    line arguments and vectors.
